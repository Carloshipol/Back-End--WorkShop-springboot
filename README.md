# About the project

Workshop is a cool Spring Boot project where we've put our critical thinking hats on and embraced some solid coding practices.

So, what's in the back end? Imagine a bustling little virtual company with all the works – users, orders, items in those orders, order statuses, product categories, payments, and of course, the products themselves.

And hey, we're not just building it, we're also taking care of those pesky errors and exceptions that might pop up along the way. We're using JPA/Hibernate to handle all that nitty-gritty data processing stuff.

Oh, and for our testing and quick queries, we've got H2, the handy in-memory database, at our service.

In a nutshell, Workshop is all about flexing our coding muscles while keeping things efficient and error-free in the back end.
